% Disclaimer: good enough for me; may not be good enough for you.  See

% A CHANGE since the 2.14-compatible (and previous) versions: this is
% now slightly more general, but more importantly, the sense of the
% pair Boolean has changed.  Previously in-pair was #f on the first
% half of a beat, and #t on the second half of a beat.  Now, on-beat
% is #t on the first half of a beat, and #f on the second half.  It
% seemed simpler, plus is was well baked-in before I realized it was
% different.  This wonâ€™t affect any uses of \sw, but if you were using
% any of these functions directly, Atheia help you.

% Some constants: durations of an eighth note, a triplet quarter, and
% a triplet eighth.

% passes this same test.

% (swing-events straight-list on-beat)

% eighth-note events, they are altered and the sense of on-beat is

% \sw music
% Turns a series of notes into two tagged sequences (tagged 'layout
% and 'midi)
% The 'layout tagged sequence is unaltered.  The 'midi tagged sequence
% has pairs of eighth notes turned into swung triplets.
% This only works if eighth notes are always in beat-wise pairs; this
% means no half-beat anacrucis, no dotted quarters, or other
% often-convenient notations.  Chords are presumed to have identical
% durations of all component notes.
